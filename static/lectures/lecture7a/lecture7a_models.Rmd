## Using optimisation to get a good fit

- GOAL: Fitted model is close to all observed points
- APPROACH: Measure the distance between the observed and fitted value, for each observation. 
- SOLUTION: Best model makes all these distances as small as possible

### Typical distances

- Squared: $\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \widehat{y_i})^2$ (Fit is called **least squares fit**)
- Absolute: $\sum_{i}|~y_i - \widehat{y_i}~|$ (Fit called **least absolute deviations**)
- Power $p$: $\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \widehat{y_i})^p$ ($p=2,4,6,... L_p$ distance)

Let's take a look, for the examples from last lecture. Data is simulated from this model:

$\widehat{y}=2+3x+x^2-2x^3$

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
x <- runif(100, -1, 1)
df <- tibble(x, y=2+3*x+x^2-2*x^3+rnorm(100)*0.2)
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point()
```

We know that $\beta_0=2, \beta_1=3, \beta_2=1, \beta_3=-2$. 

From the data, assume we DO NOT KNOW these parameter values, (*but that we do know the model family*) and we will estimate the parameters from the data provided. We need to find values for $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3$ that minimise the distance between the resulting fitted value ($\widehat{y}$) and the observed $y$.

```{r}
square_err <- function(par, data) {
  sq <- sum((data$y-(par[1]+par[2]*data$x+par[3]*data$x^2+par[4]*data$x^3))^2)
  return(sq)
}
fit <- optim(c(1,1,1,1), square_err, data=df)
df <- df %>% mutate(fitted = fit$par[1] + fit$par[2]*x +
                      fit$par[3]*x^2 + fit$par[4]*x^3)
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y=fitted), colour="blue") 
```

### Your turn

1. Get my code to work for you. Your results might vary slightly from mine, because it is generating a different sample or data, and this might result in different parameter estimates
2. Write a function to compute least absolute deviation, and run the optimisation with this instead of least squares
3. Plot the data, least squares line, and the least absolute deviation model fits.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
abs_dev_err <- function(par, data) {
  ad <- sum(abs(data$y-(par[1]+par[2]*data$x+par[3]*data$x^2+par[4]*data$x^3)))
  return(ad)
}
fit2 <- optim(c(1,1,1,1), abs_dev_err, data=df)
df <- df %>% mutate(fitted2 = fit2$par[1] + fit2$par[2]*x +
                      fit2$par[3]*x^2 + fit2$par[4]*x^3)
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y=fitted), colour="blue") +
  geom_line(aes(y=fitted2), colour="red")
```

## Components of variation

- total variation: how much does Y vary, which is what we want to explain using the other variables
- variation explained by the model
- residual variation:  what's left over after fitting the model

Open the app available at [https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/SSregression/](https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/SSregression/). (The original version was obtained from [https://github.com/paternogbc/SSregression](https://github.com/paternogbc/SSregression), developed by Gustavo Brant Paterno, a PhD student from Brazil.)

The app simulates some data using different slopes and error variance. It allows you to see how characteristics of the data affect model summaries. Time to play!

1. Vary the slope from high positive to zero. What happens to the error variance? The total variance and the regression variance (due to model)? Does the proportion of variation of each component change? How? Is this the same if you vary from large negative slope to zero?
2. Holding the slope fixed at 1, increase the standard deviation of the error model. What happens to components of variation?
3. As the slope changes, what happens to the intercept?
4. Why isn't the estimated slope the same as what is set by the slider?

```{r variance, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Which following is the `total variation`?",
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and fitted values."),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and average response.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between fitted response and average response.")),
  question("Which following is the `model variation`?",
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and fitted values."),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and average response."),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between fitted response and average response.", correct = TRUE)), 
  question("Which following is the `residual variance`?",
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and fitted values.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and average response."),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between fitted response and average response."))
)
```

## Model goodness of fit statistics

Simulate data again from this model:

$\widehat{y}=2+3x+x^2-2x^3$

Then consider these two models:

1. $\widehat{y}=b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2$
2. $\widehat{y}=b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+b_3x^3$

Model 2 would be the correct family, because it matches how we generated the data. The model goodness of fit statistics should reflect this.

```{r}
library(broom)
df <- df %>%
  mutate(x2=x^2, x3=x^3)
df_mod1 <- lm(y~x+x2, data=df)
df_mod2 <- lm(y~x+x2+x3, data=df)
glance(df_mod1)
glance(df_mod2)
```

The statistics are:

- $R^2$: (model variance)/(total variance), the amount of variance in response explained by the model. Always ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit. Adding more variables to the model will always increase $R^2$, so what is important is how big an increase is gained. Adjusted $R^2$ reduces this for every additional variable added. 
- Deviance is the residual variation, how much variation in response that IS NOT explained by the model. The close to 0 the better, but it is not on a standard scale. In comparing two models if one has substantially lower deviance, then it is a better model.
- Similarly BIC (Bayes Information Criterion) indicates how well the model fits, best used to compare two models. The lower is better.
- df is the degrees of freedom left from the model fit. Starts at $n$ (sample size) and drops for each additional parameter estimated by the model. 

All of these statistics indicate the model 2 is substantially a better fit than model 1.

### Your turn:

- For the co2 model fitting from yesterday, examine the model fit statistics for the linear model vs the one with a quadratic term. What do they indicate is the better fit?
- Try fitting the seasonal pattern with one of the ideas you came up with yesterday. Use the model fit statistics, and residual plots, to determine if the model is better than the quadratic model.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(broom)
CO2.spo <- read_csv("http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/assets/data/atmospheric/stations/merged_in_situ_and_flask/daily/daily_merge_co2_spo.csv", col_names=c("date", "time", "day", "decdate", "n", "flg", "co2"), skip=69) %>%
  mutate(lat = -90.0, lon = 0, stn = "spo") %>%
  filter(flg==0) %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date))
CO2.spo <- CO2.spo %>% mutate(day0=day-min(day))
co2_fit1 <- lm(co2~day0, data=CO2.spo)
co2_fit2 <- lm(co2~day0+I(day0^2), data=CO2.spo)
glance(co2_fit1)
glance(co2_fit2)
library(lubridate)
CO2.spo <- CO2.spo %>% mutate(month=month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE))
co2_fit3 <- lm(co2~day0+I(day0^2)+month, data=CO2.spo)
glance(co2_fit3)
co2_model3 <- augment(co2_fit3, CO2.spo)
ggplot(co2_model3, aes(x=date, y=co2)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(y=.fitted), colour="blue")
ggplot(filter(co2_model3, year(date)>1975, year(date)<1987),
       aes(x=date, y=co2)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(y=.fitted), colour="blue") 
tidy(co2_fit3)
co2_fit4 <- lm(co2~day0*month+I(day0^2)*month, data=CO2.spo)
glance(co2_fit4)
co2_model4 <- augment(co2_fit4, CO2.spo)
ggplot(co2_model4, aes(x=date, y=co2)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(y=.fitted), colour="blue")
ggplot(filter(co2_model4, year(date)>1965, year(date)<1972),
       aes(x=date, y=co2)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(y=.fitted), colour="blue") 
```

## Gapminder

Hans Rosling was a Swedish doctor, academic and statistician, Professor of International Health at Karolinska Institute. He passed away in 2017. He developed a keen interest in health and wealth across the globe, and the relationship with other factors like agriculture, education, energy. His presentations on data are amazing! A starting place is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo. 

And you can play with the gapminder data using animations at https://www.gapminder.org/tools/. 

### R package

The R package, called gapminder, contains a subset of the data. It has data on five year intervals from 1952 to 2007.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
glimpse(gapminder)
```

## Fit linear models

The question is "How has life expectancy changed over years, for each country?"

Plot life expectancy by year, for each country.

```{r fig.height=4}
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, lifeExp, group = country)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 1/3)

```

- There generally appears to be an increase in life expectancy
- A number of countries have big dips from the 70s through 90s
- a cluster of countries starts off with low life expectancy but ends up close to the highest by the end of the period.

### Mutate year

1950 is the first year, so for model fitting we are going to shift year to begin in 1950, makes interpretability easier.

```{r}
gapminder2 <- gapminder %>% mutate(year1950 = year-1950)
```

## Australia

Australia was already had one of the top life expectancies in the 1950s.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=8}
oz <- gapminder2 %>% filter(country=="Australia")
head(oz)
p1 <- ggplot(data=oz, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp)) + 
  geom_line() 
oz_lm <- lm(lifeExp~year1950, data=oz)
tidy(oz_lm)
oz_mod <- augment(oz_lm, oz)
p2 <- ggplot(data=oz_mod, aes(x=year, y=.fitted)) + 
  geom_line() 
p3 <- ggplot(data=oz_mod, aes(x=year, y=.std.resid)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, colour="white", size=2) +
  geom_line() 
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol=3)
```

- Life expectancy has increased 2.3 years every decade, on average. 
- There was a slow period from 1960 through to 1972, probably related to mortality during the Vietnam war.

```{r life, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("What was the average life expectancy in 1950?",
    answer("50"),
    answer("about 65"),
    answer("67.9", correct=TRUE)),
  question("What was the average life expectancy in 2000?",
    answer("59"),
    answer("about 69"),
    answer("79", correct=TRUE)))
```

## Fit all countries

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(purrr)
by_country <- gapminder2 %>% 
  select(country, year1950, lifeExp, continent) %>%
  group_by(country, continent) %>% 
  nest()
by_country <- by_country %>% 
  mutate(
    model = purrr::map(data, ~ lm(lifeExp ~ year1950, 
                                  data = .))
  )
country_coefs <- by_country %>% 
  unnest(model %>% purrr::map(broom::tidy))
country_coefs <- country_coefs %>% 
  select(country, continent, term, estimate) %>% 
  spread(term, estimate) %>%
  rename(intercept = `(Intercept)`)
head(country_coefs)
country_coefs %>%
  filter(country == "Australia")
```

It is also possible to use a `for` loop to compute the slope and intercept for each country.

```{r eval=FALSE}
n <- length(table(gapminder2$country))
country_coefs <- data.frame(country=gapminder2$country[seq(1, 1704, 12)],
                   continent=gapminder2$continent[seq(1, 1704, 12)],
                   intercept=rep(0,n), 
                   year1950=rep(0,n))
for (i in 1:n) {
  sub <- gapminder2 %>% filter(country==country_coefs$country[i])
  sub_lm <- lm(lifeExp~year1950, data=sub)
  sub_lm_coefs <- coefficients(sub_lm)
  country_coefs$intercept[i] <- sub_lm_coefs[1]
  country_coefs$year1950[i] <- sub_lm_coefs[2]
}
head(country_coefs)
```

### Five minute challenge

- Fit the models to all countries
- Pick your favourite country (not Australia), print the coefficients, and make a hand sketch of the the model fit.

### Plot all the models

```{r fig.height=4}
country_model <- by_country %>% 
  unnest(model %>% 
           purrr::map(broom::augment))

p1 <- gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, lifeExp, group = country)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 1/3) + ggtitle("Data")
p2 <- ggplot(country_model) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=year1950+1950, y=.fitted, group=country), alpha = 1/3) +
  xlab("year") +
  ggtitle("Fitted models")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```

### Plot all the model coefficients

```{r}
p <- ggplot(country_coefs, aes(x=intercept, y=year1950, 
                          colour=continent, label=country)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)
```

Let's summarise the information learned from the model coefficients.

- Generally the relationship is negative: this means that if a country started with a high intercept tends to have lower rate of increase.
- There is a difference across the continents: Countries in Europe and Oceania tended to start with higher life expectancy and increased; countries in Asia and America tended to start lower but have high rates of improvement; Africa tends to start lower and have a huge range in rate of change.
- Three countries had negative growth in life expectancy: Rwand, Zimbabwe, Zambia

```{r coefs, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Name the country that has the lowest improvement in life expectancy",
    answer("Zimbabwe", correct=TRUE),
    answer("Oman"),
    answer("Norway"),
    answer("Gambia")),
  question("Name the country that has the highest improvement in life expectancy",
    answer("Zimbabwe"),
    answer("Oman", correct=TRUE),
    answer("Norway"),
    answer("Gambia")),
  question("Name the country that has the lowest initial life expectancy",
    answer("Zimbabwe"),
    answer("Oman"),
    answer("Norway"),
    answer("Gambia", correct=TRUE)),
  question("Name the country that has the highest initial life expectancy",
    answer("Zimbabwe"),
    answer("Oman"),
    answer("Norway", correct=TRUE),
    answer("Gambia"))
)
```

## Model diagnostics by country

```{r}
country_fit <- by_country %>% 
  unnest(model %>% 
           purrr::map(broom::glance))
```

Or you can use a `for` loop to compute this.

```{r eval=FALSE}
n <- length(unique(gapminder2$country))
country_fit <- data.frame(country=gapminder2$country[seq(1, 1704, 12)],
                   continent=gapminder2$continent[seq(1, 1704, 12)],
                   intercept=rep(0,n), 
                   year1950=rep(0,n),
                   r.squared=rep(0,n))
for (i in 1:n) {
  sub <- gapminder2 %>% filter(country==country_fit$country[i])
  sub_lm <- lm(lifeExp~year1950, data=sub)
  sub_lm_fit <- coefficients(sub_lm)
  country_fit$intercept[i] <- sub_lm_coefs[1]
  country_fit$year1950[i] <- sub_lm_coefs[2]
  country_fit$r.squared[i] <- summary(sub_lm)$r.squared
}
head(country_fit)
```

### Plot the $R^2$ values as a histogram. 

```{r}
ggplot(country_fit, aes(x=r.squared)) + geom_histogram()
```

### Countries with worst fit

Examine the countries with the worst fit, countries with $R^2<0.45$, by making scatterplots of the data, with the linear model overlaid. 

```{r fig.height=4}
badfit <- country_fit %>% filter(r.squared <= 0.45)
gapminder2_sub <- gapminder2 %>% filter(country %in% badfit$country)
ggplot(data=gapminder2_sub, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp)) + 
         geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~country) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1950,2000,10), 
                     labels=c("1950", "60","70", "80","90","2000")) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
```

Each of these countries had been moving on a nice trajectory of increasing life expectancy, and then suffered a big dip during the time period.

### Five minute challenge

Use google to explain these dips using world history and current affairs information. 

## Lab exercise

- Download the children per woman (total fertility) data from the [gapminder web site](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
- Conduct the same analysis, as done for life expectancy.
- Find the unusual countries

The code below will help you read in the data and process it, but you will need to make some changes to do the full analysis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
fert <- read_xlsx("data/children_per_woman_total_fertility.xlsx") %>%
  rename(country = geo)
fert <- fert %>% gather(year, fert, -country) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  filter(year > 1950) %>%
  mutate(year1950 = year - 1950)
ggplot(fert, aes(x=year, y=fert, group=country)) +
  geom_line(alpha=0.1)
```
