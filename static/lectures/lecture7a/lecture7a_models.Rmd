## Gapminder

Hans Rosling was a Swedish doctor, academic and statistician, Professor of International Health at Karolinska Institute. He passed away in 2017. He developed a keen interest in health and wealth across the globe, and the relationship with other factors like agriculture, education, energy. His presentations on data are amazing! A starting place is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo. 

And you can play with the gapminder data using animations at https://www.gapminder.org/tools/. 

### R package

The R package, called gapminder, contains a subset of the data. It has data on five year intervals from 1952 to 2007.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
glimpse(gapminder)
```

## Fit linear models

The question is "How has life expectancy changed over years, for each country?"

Plot life expectancy by year, for each country.

```{r fig.height=4}
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, lifeExp, group = country)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 1/3)

```

- There generally appears to be an increase in life expectancy
- A number of countries have big dips from the 70s through 90s
- a cluster of countries starts off with low life expectancy but ends up close to the highest by the end of the period.

### Mutate year

1950 is the first year, so for model fitting we are going to shift year to begin in 1950, makes interpretability easier.

```{r}
gapminder2 <- gapminder %>% mutate(year1950 = year-1950)
```

## Australia

Australia was already had one of the top life expectancies in the 1950s.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=8}
oz <- gapminder2 %>% filter(country=="Australia")
head(oz)
p1 <- ggplot(data=oz, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp)) + 
  geom_line() 
oz_lm <- lm(lifeExp~year1950, data=oz)
tidy(oz_lm)
oz_mod <- augment(oz_lm, oz)
p2 <- ggplot(data=oz_mod, aes(x=year, y=.fitted)) + 
  geom_line() 
p3 <- ggplot(data=oz_mod, aes(x=year, y=.std.resid)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, colour="white", size=2) +
  geom_line() 
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol=3)
```

- Life expectancy has increased 2.3 years every decade, on average. 
- There was a slow period from 1960 through to 1972, probably related to mortality during the Vietnam war.

```{r life, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("What was the average life expectancy in 1950?",
    answer("50"),
    answer("about 65"),
    answer("67.9", correct=TRUE)),
  question("What was the average life expectancy in 2000?",
    answer("59"),
    answer("about 69"),
    answer("79", correct=TRUE)))
```

## Fit all countries

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(purrr)
by_country <- gapminder2 %>% 
  select(country, year1950, lifeExp, continent) %>%
  group_by(country, continent) %>% 
  nest()
by_country <- by_country %>% 
  mutate(
    model = purrr::map(data, ~ lm(lifeExp ~ year1950, 
                                  data = .))
  )
country_coefs <- by_country %>% 
  unnest(model %>% purrr::map(broom::tidy))
country_coefs <- country_coefs %>% 
  select(country, continent, term, estimate) %>% 
  spread(term, estimate) %>%
  rename(intercept = `(Intercept)`)
head(country_coefs)
country_coefs %>%
  filter(country == "Australia")
```

It is also possible to use a `for` loop to compute the slope and intercept for each country.

```{r eval=FALSE}
n <- length(table(gapminder2$country))
country_coefs <- data.frame(country=gapminder2$country[seq(1, 1704, 12)],
                   continent=gapminder2$continent[seq(1, 1704, 12)],
                   intercept=rep(0,n), 
                   year1950=rep(0,n))
for (i in 1:n) {
  sub <- gapminder2 %>% filter(country==country_coefs$country[i])
  sub_lm <- lm(lifeExp~year1950, data=sub)
  sub_lm_coefs <- coefficients(sub_lm)
  country_coefs$intercept[i] <- sub_lm_coefs[1]
  country_coefs$year1950[i] <- sub_lm_coefs[2]
}
head(country_coefs)
```

### Five minute challenge

- Fit the models to all countries
- Pick your favourite country (not Australia), print the coefficients, and make a hand sketch of the the model fit.

### Plot all the models

```{r fig.height=4}
country_model <- by_country %>% 
  unnest(model %>% 
           purrr::map(broom::augment))

p1 <- gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, lifeExp, group = country)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 1/3) + ggtitle("Data")
p2 <- ggplot(country_model) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=year1950+1950, y=.fitted, group=country), alpha = 1/3) +
  xlab("year") +
  ggtitle("Fitted models")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```

### Plot all the model coefficients

```{r}
p <- ggplot(country_coefs, aes(x=intercept, y=year1950, 
                          colour=continent, label=country)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)
```

Let's summarise the information learned from the model coefficients.

- Generally the relationship is negative: this means that if a country started with a high intercept tends to have lower rate of increase.
- There is a difference across the continents: Countries in Europe and Oceania tended to start with higher life expectancy and increased; countries in Asia and America tended to start lower but have high rates of improvement; Africa tends to start lower and have a huge range in rate of change.
- Three countries had negative growth in life expectancy: Rwand, Zimbabwe, Zambia

```{r coefs, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Name the country that has the lowest improvement in life expectancy",
    answer("Zimbabwe", correct=TRUE),
    answer("Vietnam"),
    answer("Norway"),
    answer("Gambia")),
  question("Name the country that has the highest improvement in life expectancy",
    answer("Zimbabwe", correct=TRUE),
    answer("Vietnam"),
    answer("Norway"),
    answer("Gambia")),
  question("Name the country that has the lowest initial life expectancy",
    answer("Zimbabwe"),
    answer("Vietnam"),
    answer("Norway"),
    answer("Gambia", correct=TRUE)),
  question("Name the country that has the highest initial life expectancy",
    answer("Zimbabwe"),
    answer("Vietnam"),
    answer("Norway", correct=TRUE),
    answer("Gambia"))
)
```

## Model diagnostics by country

```{r}
country_fit <- by_country %>% 
  unnest(model %>% 
           purrr::map(broom::glance))
```

Or you can use a `for` loop to compute this.

```{r eval=FALSE}
n <- length(unique(gapminder2$country))
country_fit <- data.frame(country=gapminder2$country[seq(1, 1704, 12)],
                   continent=gapminder2$continent[seq(1, 1704, 12)],
                   intercept=rep(0,n), 
                   year1950=rep(0,n),
                   r.squared=rep(0,n))
for (i in 1:n) {
  sub <- gapminder2 %>% filter(country==country_fit$country[i])
  sub_lm <- lm(lifeExp~year1950, data=sub)
  sub_lm_fit <- coefficients(sub_lm)
  country_fit$intercept[i] <- sub_lm_coefs[1]
  country_fit$year1950[i] <- sub_lm_coefs[2]
  country_fit$r.squared[i] <- summary(sub_lm)$r.squared
}
head(country_fit)
```

### Plot the $R^2$ values as a histogram. 

```{r}
ggplot(country_fit, aes(x=r.squared)) + geom_histogram()
```

### Countries with worst fit

Examine the countries with the worst fit, countries with $R^2<0.45$, by making scatterplots of the data, with the linear model overlaid. 

```{r fig.height=4}
badfit <- country_fit %>% filter(r.squared <= 0.45)
gapminder2_sub <- gapminder2 %>% filter(country %in% badfit$country)
ggplot(data=gapminder2_sub, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp)) + 
         geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~country) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1950,2000,10), 
                     labels=c("1950", "60","70", "80","90","2000")) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
```

Each of these countries had been moving on a nice trajectory of increasing life expectancy, and then suffered a big dip during the time period.

### Five minute challenge

Use google to explain these dips using world history and current affairs information. 

## Lab exercise

- Download the children per woman (total fertility) data from the [gapminder web site](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
- Conduct the same analysis, as done for life expectancy.
- Find the unusual countries

The code below will help you read in the data and process it, but you will need to make some changes to do the full analysis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
fert <- read_xlsx("data/indicator undata total_fertility.xlsx") 
colnames(fert)[1] <- "country"
fert <- fert %>% gather(year, fert, -country) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  filter(year > 1950)
ggplot(fert, aes(x=year, y=fert, group=country)) +
  geom_line(alpha=0.1)
```
