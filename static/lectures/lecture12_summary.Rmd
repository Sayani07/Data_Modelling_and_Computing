# What have we covered!

Congratulations! You've made it to the second last week of semester. Here's what I hope you know a lot about by now:

- Reading many different data formats: shapefiles, sound files, extracting html tables, finding data files in web sites and reading them all, binary software data like SPSS, SAS, Stata, json, google sheets, xlsx, making and utilising a small data base, ...
- Melting the data into tidy form, and recasting it into different shapes
- Taming the data into a usable format, using the verbs filter, arrange, select, mutate, summarise, and handle missing values by determining relationships between missings and not missings and how to impute them

# What have we covered!

- Use the grammar to create data plots, know how to map variables into appropriate graphical elements. Know how to read plots, to explain how variables are distributed and related, and detect unusual observations or patterns. 
- The interplay of optimisation and modeling, how to map a question into a linear programming problem, to solve using an optimisation. How to incorporate constraints into an optimisation problem.
- Fitting and diagnosing linear models, fitting a computationally intensive model such as a decision tree, and how to do model building.

# How to cram for the exam!

- The practice exam is very accurate
- None of the questions on the practice exam is on the actual exam, though. 
- The actual exam questions are similar, in style and make-up and length
- Try to do the practice exam question, before you check solution. If you don't understand the solution get some help.
- Try to brainstorm some similar questions, ideally with your study group, and work out how to do them
- Review lab questions and solutions
- Review weekly quiz questions, and in-class quizzes. The weekly quizzes are focused closely on the reading material but there are some questions general enough that they could be n the exam
- Each question on the exam has some easy parts and some difficult parts
- I will have consultation time - same as usual in swotvac. You can also email me to make an appointment.

# What courses to take to become a data scientist

If you have found this course interesting, and you are still young in your study, these are the subsequent classes:

- ETC2420 Statistical Thinking using Randomisation and Simulation: Learn more about statistics, statistical distributions, game building, more advanced models and diagnostics, bagging, boosting, building confidence and prediction intervals
- ETC3250 Business Analytics: Dimension reduction, supervised classification, cluster analysis, machine learning. 
- Electives: Forecasting, advanced statistical modeling, high dimensional data analysis, data visualisation, databases, ...
