<h3>What is R?</h3>
<p><em>R is a language for data analysis. If R seems a bit confusing, disorganized, and perhaps incoherent at times, in some ways that‚Äôs because so is data analysis.</em> Roger Peng, 12/07/2018</p>

<h2>Getting set up</h2>
<ul>
<li>‚úàÔ∏è R (2018-07-02, Feather Spray): <a href="https://cran.ms.unimelb.edu.au">Install this first</a> because it is what does the work</li>
<li>üõÑ RStudio 1.1.453: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">Install the free version</a> because it helps you work with R.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need help on these the <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu">DataCamp installation page can help</a>.</p>
<p><em>If R were an airplane, RStudio would be the airport</b>, providing many, many supporting services that make it easier for you, the pilot, to take off and go to awesome places. Sure, you can fly an airplane without an airport, but having those runways and supporting infrastructure is a game-changer</em> <a href="http://jules32.github.io/resources/RStudio_intro/">Julie Lowndes</a></p>
<div id="section-cheatsheets" class="section level3">
<h3>Cheatsheets</h3>
<p>RStudio started a trend by writing really concise summaries, and others have added to the collection. You can find the RStudio collection at <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/</a>.</p>
<p>Start with the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf">RStudio IDE cheatsheet</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-using-the-ide" class="section level3">
<h3>Using the IDE</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: This is like a multi-tab folder, or a filing cabinet, for your work! Create a project for your work in this class. Just one should be sufficient. You can call it anything you like, or ‚ÄúETC1010‚Äù if you don‚Äôt have any better ideas. <em>Remember: every time you start to work on something for this class, open this project!!</em></li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/files.jpg" />

</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source code editor</strong>: This is where you edit your script! Experiment with writing your data analysis pipeline, ‚Ä¶ You can have multiple files open, there are useful shortcuts (eg ‚ÄúRun‚Äù, ‚ÄúKnit‚Äù), code is highlighted usefully and there is tab-completion when you start typing. <em>Also, if you want to look at any of the data you have read or created, it can be viewed in a tab on this pane.</em></li>
<li><strong>Console window</strong>: This is where the code is executed. There is a prompt ‚Äú&gt;‚Äù which says <em>R is waiting for your command</em>. You don‚Äôt actually need to type anything in this pane, you can run code directly from the Editor pane. The functions will show up in this window, and the results will be here. (Although, if you use an R notebook the result will show up in that notebook.)</li>
<li><strong>Help</strong>: <em>?function</em> will show the help pages for the function here.</li>
<li><strong>Plot</strong>: Plots you ask R to make will show up here, and you can zoom to make them bigger in a separate window if you want.</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong>: Data that you have read into R, or data or functions that you create will be listed here. <strong>When you quit R, you will be asked if you want to save the environment. I suggest that you always answer NO.</strong> Because we are scripting everything it is always easy to re-create the objects in the environment. The only time it can be useful is if you have created something that took a while, but a better option is to save this object to a file, and read it in at the start of the next R session.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="section-lets-start-writing" class="section level2">
<h2>Let‚Äôs start writing‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>(This section is based on <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html" class="uri">http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html</a>)</p>
<p>In your RStudio console pane, let‚Äôs tell R to do some things.</p>
<div id="section-calculator" class="section level3">
<h3>Calculator</h3>
<p>You can use R as a calculator:</p>
<pre><code>1 / 200 * 30
(59 + 73 + 2) / 3
sin(pi / 2)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-create-objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Create objects</h3>
<p>You can create new objects with <code>&lt;-</code>:</p>
<pre><code>x &lt;- 3 * 4</code></pre>
<p>Check your environment pane, and you should see an object called <code>x</code>. You can inspect an object by typing its name (in the console pane):</p>
<pre><code>x</code></pre>
<p>Make another assignment:</p>
<pre><code>this_is_a_really_long_name &lt;- 2.5</code></pre>
<p>To inspect this object, try out RStudio‚Äôs completion facility: type ‚Äúthis‚Äù, press TAB, add characters until you have a unique prefix, then press return.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs make another object:</p>
<pre><code>r_rocks &lt;- 2 ^ 3</code></pre>
<p>Now inspect it:</p>
<pre><code>r_rock</code></pre>
<p>Oops, try again:</p>
<pre><code>R_rocks</code></pre>
<p>Oops!</p>
<p>There‚Äôs an implied contract between you and R: it will do the tedious computation for you, but in return, you must be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-calling-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Calling functions</h3>
<p>R has a large collection of built-in functions that are called like this:</p>
<pre><code>function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)</code></pre>
<p>Let‚Äôs create a vector of data, and use some functions to compute statistics:</p>
<pre><code>x &lt;- c(-1, 4, 2, -2, -1, 0, -4, 10)
mean(x)
median(x)
sd(x)
range(x)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-there-are-many-ways" class="section level3">
<h3>There are many ways‚Ä¶</h3>
<p>There can be many ways to achieve the same result. I don‚Äôt know everything. You might find a better solution than I have give you. Your tutors might give you different ways to do it than I told you.</p>

<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>There are more than 14000 packages available on the main archive contributed by experts (and relatively new to R people too).

<h3>Learning objectives</h3>
<p>The learning goals associated with this unit are to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>apply principles and techniques of data management with computers and spreadsheet modelling to business and economic decision-making</li>
<li>interpret and evaluate relationships between variables using simple and multiple linear regression</li>
<li>apply statistical techniques for making decisions with quantitative and categorical data in business and economics.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Data preparation accounts for about 80% of the work of data scientists</strong></p>

<p><em>This is one of the least taught parts of data science, and business analytics, and yet it is what data scientists spend most of their time on. By the end of this semester, we hope that you will have the tools to be more efficient and effective in this area, so that you have more time to spend on your mining and modeling.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="section-philosophy" class="section level3">
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>‚ÄúIf you feed a person a fish, they eat for a day. If you teach a person to fish, they eat for a lifetime.‚Äù</p>
<p>Whatever I do in the data analysis that is shown to you during the class, you can do it, too.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Grading</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reading quizzes: 5% - Prior to each class, check the web site. Quiz needs to be completed by class time.</li>
<li>Lab exercise: 10% - Each class period will have a quiz to be completed individually.</li>
<li>Assignment: 10% - Every two weeks, completed as a group</li>
<li>Project: 15% - Data analysis, report and presentation</li>
<li>Final Exam: 60%</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-move-unit" class="section level3">
<h3>MoVE unit</h3>
<p>If you are enrolled in a MoVE unit and forget your laptop, or do not own one as yet, please visit the locations below to borrow a laptop for an activity or part of a day: Clayton: Room 2.24 - Level 2, Learning and Teaching Building</p>
<p>You‚Äôre required to provide proof of ID (student card or personal ID) in order to borrow a laptop. This service is open from 7.45am - 7.00pm on Monday to Friday.</p>
<p><em>Access to R is through a server. Last year we found that this was a slow way to work. The most successful approach was to have a USB stick, attach to the borrowed laptop, and install R, RStudio and all your packages on this. Use this as your working environment, with the borrowed laptop simply as the computing engine.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="section-group-assignments" class="section level3">
<h3>Group assignments</h3>
<p>Group assignments will be conducted according to the <a href="https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/1098659/Team-Assessment-Guidelines.pdf">Monash policies</a>.</p>
<p>What we expect to see is that each member of the group completes the entire assignment, as best they can. Group members compare their answers and combine it into one document for the final asubmission.</p>
<p>Individual submissions will be done during Wednesday class, and the group submission will be done in the Friday class. 25% of the grade will come from the individual submission. If any individual assignment is a perfect match for another group member, both will receive zero. 50% of the grade will come from the final group submission. These points are awarded by the instructor‚Äôs grading.</p>
<p>The other 25% of the assignment grade will come from peer evaluation. Peer evaluation is an important learning tool. Each student will be randomly assigned another team‚Äôs submission to provide feedback on three things: (1) Could you reproduce the analysis? (2) Did you learn something new from the other team‚Äôs approach? (3) What would you suggest to improve their work?</p>
<p>Conflicts can arise in group work. Conflict can be both productive and destructive. Teams need to work on managing conflicts and building on the strengths of all team members. If the group becomes unmanageble then the members need to consult with the instructor.</p>
<div id="section-making-the-groups" class="section level4">
<h4>Making the groups</h4>
<p>Here we are going to set up the groups for doing assignment work.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose a hex sticker design from the bag.</li>
<li>Find the other people in the class with the same design as you</li>
<li>Grab your gear and claim a table to work together at.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some icebreakers to help you get to know each other:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you were a comic strip character, who would you be and why?</li>
<li>What thought or message would you want to put in a fortune cookie?</li>
<li>What is one food you‚Äôd never want to taste again?</li>
<li>What award would you love to win and for what achievement?</li>
</ol>
<p>LASTLY, come up with a name for your team and tell this to a tutor, along with the names of members of the team.</p>
