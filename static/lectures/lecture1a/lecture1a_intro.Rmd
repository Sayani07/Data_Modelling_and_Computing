## About your instructors

Welcome to ETC1010: Data Modelling and Computing, semester 2, 2018.

- Di: a professor at Monash University in Melbourne Australia, research in statistics, data science, visualisation, and statistical computing. I like to play all sorts of sports, tennis, soccer, hockey, cricket, and go boogie boarding.
- Steph: is a graduate from Monash, and just started a Masters of Statistics at QUT based at Monash, working on cancer maps for Australia.

## Language of data analysis

*This course is brought to you today by the letter "R"!*

### What is R? 

*R is a language for data analysis. If R seems a bit confusing, disorganized, and perhaps incoherent at times, in some ways that's because so is data analysis.* Roger Peng, 12/07/2018

### Why R?

* [Most commonly used data science software](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/05/poll-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-software-leaders.html) - helps YOU the job market

![](images/kdd_software.png)

* __Free__
* __Powerful__: Over 14000 contributed packages from top researchers globally
* __Flexible__: It is a language, and thus allows you to create your own solutions
* __Community__: Large global community friendly and helpful, lots of resources

### It's a new language!

```{r}
library(emo)
set.seed(2019)
```

`r emo::ji("cartwheel")` Flexibility <--------> Complexity `r emo::ji("nervous")`

`r emo::ji("swim")` Ability to program <---------> Programming requirement `r emo::ji("scream")`

*It's taught to New Zealand high school students!* 

### Community tidbits

R Consortium conducted a survey of users 2017.

These are the locations of respondents to an R Consortium survey conducted in 2017.

![](images/R_community.png)

**8% of R users are between 18-24 BUT 45% of R users are between 25-34!**

Sample of Australian organisations/companies that sent employees to [useR! 2018](https://user2018.r-project.org): ABS, CSIRO, ATO, Microsoft, Energy Qld, Auto and General, Bank of Qld, BHP, AEMO, Google, Flight Centre, Youi, Amadeus Investment Partners,  Yahoo, Sydney Trains, Tennis Australia, Rio Tinto, Reserve Bank of Australia, PwC, Oracle, Netflix, NOAA Fisheries, NAB, Menulog, Macquarie Bank, Honeywell, Geoscience Australia, DFAT, DPI, CBA, Bank of Italy, Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Amazon, Bunnings.

## Getting set up

```{r}
set.seed(2018)
```

- `r emo::ji("airplane")` R (2018-07-02, Feather Spray): [Install this first](https://cran.ms.unimelb.edu.au) because it is what does the work
- `r emo::ji("airport")` RStudio 1.1.453: [Install the free version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) because it helps you work with R.

If you need help on these the [DataCamp installation page can help](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu).

*If R were an airplane, RStudio would be the airport</b>, providing many, many supporting services that make it easier for you, the pilot, to take off and go to awesome places. Sure, you can fly an airplane without an airport, but having those runways and supporting infrastructure is a game-changer* [Julie Lowndes](http://jules32.github.io/resources/RStudio_intro/) 


### Cheatsheets

RStudio started a trend by writing really concise summaries, and others have added to the collection. You can find the RStudio collection at https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/. 

Start with the [RStudio IDE cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf). 

### Using the IDE

- __Project__: This is like a multi-tab folder, or a filing cabinet, for your work! Create a project for your work in this class. Just one should be sufficient. You can call it anything you like, or "ETC1010" if you don't have any better ideas. *Remember: every time you start to work on something for this class, open this project!!*

![](images/files.png)

- __Source code editor__: This is where you edit your script! Experiment with writing your data analysis pipeline, ... You can have multiple files open, there are useful shortcuts (eg "Run", "Knit"), code is highlighted usefully and there is tab-completion when you start typing. *Also, if you want to look at any of the data you have read or created, it can be viewed in a tab on this pane.*
- __Console window__: This is where the code is executed. There is a prompt ">" which says *R is waiting for your command*. You don't actually need to type anything in this pane, you can run code directly from the Editor pane. The functions will show up in this window, and the results will be here. (Although, if you use an R notebook the result will show up in that notebook.)
- __Help__: *?function* will show the help pages for the function here.
- __Plot__: Plots you ask R to make will show up here, and you can zoom to make them bigger in a separate window if you want.
- __Environment__: Data that you have read into R, or data or functions that you create will be listed here. **When you quit R, you will be asked if you want to save the environment. I suggest that you always answer NO.** Because we are scripting everything it is always easy to re-create the objects in the environment. The only time it can be useful is if you have created something that took a while, but a better option is to save this object to a file, and read it in at the start of the next R session.

## Let's start writing...

(This section is based on http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html)

In your RStudio console pane, let's tell R to do some things.

### Calculator

You can use R as a calculator:

```
1 / 200 * 30
(59 + 73 + 2) / 3
sin(pi / 2)
```

### Create objects

You can create new objects with `<-`:

```
x <- 3 * 4
```

Check your environment pane, and you should see an object called `x`.
You can inspect an object by typing its name (in the console pane):

```
x
```

Make another assignment:

```
this_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5
```

To inspect this object, try out RStudio’s completion facility: type "this", press TAB, add characters until you have a unique prefix, then press return.

Let's make another object:

```
r_rocks <- 2 ^ 3
```

Now inspect it:

```
r_rock
```

Oops, try again:

```
R_rocks
```

Oops!

There’s an implied contract between you and R: it will do the tedious computation for you, but in return, you must be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters.

### Calling functions

R has a large collection of built-in functions that are called like this:

```
function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)
```

Let's create a vector of data, and use some functions to compute statistics:

```
x <- c(-1, 4, 2, -2, -1, 0, -4, 10)
mean(x)
median(x)
sd(x)
range(x)
```

### There are many ways...

![](http://compeap.com/wp-content/uploads/you-dont-know-everything.jpg)

There can be many ways to achieve the same result. I don't know everything. You might find a better solution than I have give you. Your tutors might give you different ways to do it than I told you. 

## Packages

There are more than 14000 packages available on the main archive contributed by experts (and relatively new to R people too). There are another several hundred on the bioconductor archive, focused primarily on bioinformatics applications. There are many more on people's github pages, that may be in development.

### Install packages

- From CRAN 
![](images/R.jpg)

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("learnr")
```

- From bioconductor
![](images/Bioconductor_original.png)
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("ggbio")
```

- From github repos
![](images/github.png)
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
devtools::install_github("dicook/nullabor")
```

### Use packages

**Install once, use many times**

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(learnr)
```
