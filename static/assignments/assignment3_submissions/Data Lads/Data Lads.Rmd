```{r cars}

library(gridExtra)
library(broom)
library(labelled)
library(naniar)
library(visdat)
library(viridis)
library(dplyr)
library(impute)
## Read in data.
houses_original <- read_csv("data/Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv")
summary(houses_original)
## As we focus only on the following variables: Price, Rooms, Type, Distance, Bedroom2 and Bathroom; we need to select these variables.
houses <- houses_original %>%
  select(Price, Rooms, Type, Distance, Bedroom2, Bathroom) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Price))
#### Some of these variables are easy to understand at first glance but some can be difficult to interpret.
#### In order to get more information about what these variables truly mean, we look at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market 
#### This denotes the meanings of all variables that are in the data set.
#### Price: Price in dollars
#### Rooms: Number of rooms
#### Type: br - bedroom(s); h - house,cottage,villa, semi,terrace; u - unit, duplex; t - townhouse; dev site - development site; o res - other residential.
#### Distance: Distance from CBD
#### Bedroom2: Scraped # of Bedrooms (from different source)
#### Bathroom: Number of Bathrooms

summary(houses)
#### 34,857 houses in total
#### 7610 missing values in Price
#### 0 missing values in Rooms
#### 0 missing values in Type
#### 1 missing value in Distance
#### 8217 missing value in Bedroom2
#### 8226 missing value in Bathroom
vis_dat(houses)
vis_miss(houses, sort_miss=TRUE) + theme(aspect.ratio=1)
miss_summary(houses)
#### These summaries tell us that missing values for Bedroom2 fall on the same observations as the missing values for Bathroom. These missing values differ from Price. This means that there could be a common theme for why missing values appear for the same house for Bedroom and Bathroom. The summary also tells us that around 40% of the cases contain missing values. This is almost half of the observations, meaning that discounting these values will discount almost half of the data attained. 
#### The variables with the greatest amount of missing values are Price, Bedroom2 and Bathroom. The summary also states that distance does have a missing value however it does not come up in the plotted graphs.
#houses_wo_missings %>%
  na.omit(houses)
#### This code will remove all missing values, but it can been seen that this removes almost half of the data. In order to retain the majority of the data, a new strategy must be used.
#### Given the number of missing values is very small for distance, we can find the row in which the missing values falls under using the code below. From this code we could look at the area in which the house is in and then insert the distance from the houses that are in that same suburb
houses_original[houses_original=='NA'] <- NA
new_distmissing <- subset(houses_original, is.na(houses_original$Distance))
#new_distmissing
#houses_fawkner <- subset(houses_original, houses_original$Suburb == "Fawkner Lot")
#houses_fawkner
#### Dataset shows that the missing value in Distance is from a house located in Fawkner Lot. A quick google search shows that Fawkner Lot is located approximately 10 kms outside of Melbourne and therefore this NA value shall be changed to 10
houses$Distance[is.na(houses$Distance)] <- 10
summary(houses$Distance)
#### Now we need to change the other missing values in the data set
houses_shadow <- bind_shadow(houses)
#### The shadow table is created to mark the location of the missing values in the original data set

#### We next predict the value of variables Bathroom and Bedroom2 from a linear relationship between Rooms and Bathroom/Bedroom2
br_lm <- lm(Bedroom2~Rooms, data=houses)
ba_lm <- lm(Bathroom~Rooms, data=houses)
houses_shadow <- houses_shadow %>%
  mutate(Bathroom= ifelse(is.na(Bathroom), 
                             predict(ba_lm, .),
                             Bathroom),
         Bedroom2 = ifelse(is.na(Bedroom2), 
                              predict(br_lm, .),
                             Bedroom2))


#### We now plot the values and the visual representation will help to distinguish if the imputed values fit the model
ggplot(houses_shadow, aes(Rooms,Bathroom, color=Bathroom_NA)) +
   scale_colour_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  facet_grid(.~Type) 
  
ggplot(houses_shadow, aes(Rooms,Bedroom2, color=Bedroom2_NA)) +
   scale_colour_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  geom_miss_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  facet_grid(.~Type) 
#### These graphs show that the imputed values fit the model



ggplot(houses_shadow, aes(x=Price)) + 
  geom_density()
houses_shadow <- houses_shadow %>% 
  mutate(lPrice=log10(Price))
#### Due to the fact that Price is left-skewed, we must take log10(Price)
#### Now using lPrice, this will privide a better representation of the data
ggplot(houses_shadow, aes(x=lPrice)) + 
  geom_density()

#### The graphs below will show the relationship between Price and no. of Rooms that a house has
ggplot(houses_shadow, aes(x=Rooms, y=Price)) + 
  geom_point()
ggplot(houses_shadow, aes(y=lPrice, x=Rooms)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
#### The graphs shows that with increasing number of rooms, a higher price is derrived.

#### Next we will derive the model that the data represents. We do this by creating an interaction between Rooms and Type as these two variables are somewhat reliant on eachother given that different types of houses will have a different amount of Rooms
houses_lm <- lm(lPrice~Rooms*Type+Distance+Bedroom2+Bathroom, data=houses_shadow)
tidy(houses_lm)
#### This final plot shows the relationship of Price and number of Rooms, using a line graph in order to better represent the different types that are included in the model.
ggplot(houses_lm, aes(x=Rooms, y=lPrice , colour=Type)) + 
  geom_line()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
