end.rcode-->
the numbers and situation of NA in different variable, 1 means it is in the data,0 means it is missed, we can see about 5831 data only missed price


our strategy about dealing with these missing values are ignoring them first, then trying to fill them by modelb
<!--begin.rcode
houses2 <- na.omit(houses1)
md.pattern(houses2)
end.rcode-->
all missed value is ignored in the first place since we do not have enough information to fill these NA, for realestate data, we need consider a lot factors rather than just one or two. For instance, price can be decided by its distance, rooms or type, so, if we just make a sequence based a single factor, it may will lead to unacceptable biases, for the same reason we cannot use their mean or median to replace these NA
Therefore we just ignore all observation whose information is incomplete, and try to fill them by model later

These plots indicated the relationship between distance and price in different situation
seems like price shown a curve in most situation, so we dicided to log the price

the first model type we tried is single factor model, we will see the relation ship between price and different factors, seems like in single factor model, Distance model(sim2) has the lowest R^2

<!--begin.rcode
sim11 <- lm(Price ~ Rooms+Distance, data=houses2)
sim12 <- lm(Price ~ Rooms*Distance, data=houses2)

end.rcode-->
by adding another factor, the adjusted r^2 of model is significantly improved, and for rooms and distance, the model with interaction has higher adjusted r^2, therefore rooms will be times by distance in our final model

<!--begin.rcode
sim19 <- lm(Price ~ Distance+Bedroom2, data=houses2)
sim20 <- lm(Price ~ Distance*Bedroom2, data=houses2)
sim21 <- lm(Price ~ Distance+Bathroom, data=houses2)
sim22 <- lm(Price ~ Distance*Bathroom, data=houses2)
sim23 <- lm(Price ~ Distance+Type, data=houses2)
sim24 <- lm(Price ~ Distance*Type, data=houses2)

glance(sim19)
glance(sim20)
glance(sim21)
glance(sim22)
glance(sim23)
glance(sim24)
end.rcode-->
In theses 6 models, models with interaction shown a higher adjusted r^2 compared with models without interaction. Therefore, in final model, distance will have interaction with other factors


<!--begin.rcode
sim25 <- lm(Price ~ Bedroom2+Bathroom, data=houses2)
sim26 <- lm(Price ~ Bedroom2*Bathroom, data=houses2)
sim27 <- lm(Price ~ Bedroom2+Type, data=houses2)
sim28 <- lm(Price ~ Bedroom2*Type, data=houses2)
sim29 <- lm(Price ~ Bathroom+Type, data=houses2)
sim30 <- lm(Price ~ Bathroom*Type, data=houses2)

glance(sim25)
glance(sim26)
glance(sim27)
glance(sim28)
glance(sim29)
glance(sim30)
end.rcode-->
In these 6 models, there is not significant difference between model with interaction and model without interaction, therefore there will not be between these factors in the final model

<!--begin.rcode
sim41 <- lm(Price ~ Distance*Rooms+Distance*Bedroom2+Distance*Bathroom+Distance*Type, data=houses2)
sim42 <- lm(Price ~ Distance*Rooms*Bedroom2*Bathroom*Type, data=houses2)

glance(sim41)
glance(sim42)
glance(sim43)
tidy(sim43)
end.rcode-->
so far, the best model we get is sim43, by this model, more than half changes in price can be explained by change in these independent variables

<!--begin.rcode
houses2 <- add_predictions(houses2, sim43)
tbg21 <- filter(houses2, Bathroom <= 2 & Rooms <= 8)

ggplot(houses2, aes(logprice, resid))+
  geom_ref_line(h = 0)+
  geom_point()
end.rcode-->
This is about the residuals situation of sim43

```{r}

<!--begin.rcode
rooms_calsulation <-  houses %>%
  mutate(special = Bedroom2 + Bathroom)

rooms_changing <- rooms_calsulation %>%
  mutate(Rooms = if_else(Rooms < !is.na(special),special, Rooms))

houses3 <-  rooms_changing %>%
  select(Price, Rooms, Type, Distance, Bedroom2, Bathroom)


houses4 <- houses3 %>%
  mutate(
    Distance = if_else(
      is.na(Distance), mean(Distance, na.rm = TRUE), Distance),
    Bedroom2 = if_else(
      is.na(Bedroom2), as.integer(median(Bedroom2, na.rm = TRUE)), Bedroom2    ),
    Bathroom = if_else(
      is.na(Bathroom), as.integer(median(Bathroom, na.rm = TRUE)), Bathroom
    ))
  
  md.pattern(houses4)
end.rcode-->

We filled the missing value of distance by its mean, filling the Bedroom and Bathroom by their median.

<!--begin.rcode
houses4 <- houses4 %>%
  mutate(Type = sub("u", "0", Type),
         Type = sub("t", "1", Type),
         Type = sub("h", "2", Type))  
houses4 <- mutate(houses4, logprice = log(Price))
houses4 <- add_predictions(houses4, sim43)
houses4 <- add_residuals(houses4, sim43)


houses4 <- houses4 %>%
  mutate(
    Price = ifelse(is.na(Price), exp(pred), Price)
  )
md.pattern(houses4)
end.rcode-->
Type is changed from a catorgorical vairbale to a numberical variable for regression line prediction, now all missed price is filled, some logprice and resid are missed is because we don't have original data of these price, so we are not sure about the resid with these price.
