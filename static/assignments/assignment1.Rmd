# Instructions

- This is a team assignment. 
- You need to write a report with answers to each of the questions. 
- Turn in the `html` output file, and also the `Rmd` file. 
- Total points for the assignment is 20. Five points of the score from the assignment will be given by another team, who will give you full marks if they can compile your report, and get the same answers as you, and find your explanations of the plots understandable and informative. Five points will be for individual effort. And the remaining 10 points will be the final group report.

# Exercise

- From the ABS web site data has been extracted on educational attainment, age and sex from the most recent 3 Census collections. Read the data in, skipping the irrelevant lines, for example.

```
library(readxl)
census_2006 <- read_xlsx("data/ABS_ed_age_sex_2006.xlsx", skip=6, n_max=50)
```

1. Tidy the data, to produce a data set with these columns: census, educ, age, sex, count

2. Combine the data from the three different census periods

3. Aggregate the counts across sex, and age, and compute the totals across educ, for each census. Plot these totals against the census year, using a line connecting values for each educ group. Write a couple of paragraphs about what you learn.

4. Subset the data to age group 25-29. Make a plot of educ counts by census year, facetted by sex. Write a couple of paragraphs about what you learn.

5. Subset the data to age groups, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34. Make a plot of educ counts by census year, facetted by age group and sex. Write a couple of paragraphs about what you learn.
