# Instructions

- This is a team assignment. You can create your own team, of between 2-4 people. 
- You need to write a report that 
    - details each step in the data cleaning that you have done. Try to do it all in R, if you need help, there are consultation times Thu, Fri, Mon. The data is small enough that you could make all the changes in excel, but if you meet a much larger data set, this would be terribly painful. 
    - provides some good summary plots of interesting things about the class. Aim for about 2-3 pages, only include what you think are the most intersting things to learn.
- Turn in your cleaned data, the `html` output file, and also the `Rmd` file.
- Use your team name on the report
- Separately you need to provide a separate page to one of the tutors that contains the team name, members of the team, and the % effort from each team member. Your grade for the assignment will be adjusted by % effort. If the effort is different from 1/n, all members need to sign off on this.
- Total points for the assignment is 20. Five points of the score from the assignment will be given by another team, who will give you full marks if they can compile your report, and get the same answers as you, and find your explanations of the plots understandable and informative.

# Exercise

- Tidy the class survey data
- Tell us some interesting facts about your classmates

# Help

- A pdf copy of the survey is provided, so you can remember what the questions were, and what answers were possible. 

- You can read the data in with this code:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
survey <- read_csv("data/survey.csv")
```

- These are many problems with the data, that need to be fixed in order to do analysis, or even make good plots. Here are some
    - Answers to Q2 include "1/2" (you would need to change this to 0.5), "2 hours ( to uni)" (you would need to remove everything except 2), ...
    - Answers to Q5 include "Choosing not to answer" (needs to be turned into NA), "72\n" (needs the "\n" removed), "40hrs" (needs "hrs" removed)
    - Answers to Q10 are pretty good, with the exception of "1\n" (needs "\n" removed)
    - Answers to Q21 are pretty good, with the exception of "7;30" and "6\n"
    - Answers to Q22 are pretty good, with the exception of "3days"
    - Answers to Q23 are pretty good, with the exception of "XXI"
    - Answers to Q24 are pretty good, with the exception of "I don't know", needs to be turned into NA.
