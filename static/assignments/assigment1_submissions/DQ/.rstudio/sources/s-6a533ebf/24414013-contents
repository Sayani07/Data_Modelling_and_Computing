##My Name is Dewei_Qiu, student id: 25893076, last week i miss the class for grouping, so i do the assignment by myself. Also there is a bit problem in my laptop to knit outcome HTML, the error show below:

##Error in read_fun(path = path, sheet = sheet, limits = limits, shim = shim, : Evaluation Error: Path[1]


##Exercise 1

From the web site Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities download the Airport Traffic Data 1985?C86 to 2016?C17. It is 2.7Mb.

#Extract the ??Airport Passengers?? table into R with this code.

```{r  setup, include=FALSE}

library(readxl)

passengers <- read_xls("WebAirport_FY_1986-2017.xls", sheet=3, skip=6)

```

#Tidy the data, to produce a data set with these columns

airport: all of the airports. (You can remove the TOTAL, because this can be easily recalculated as needed.)

year

type_of_flight: DOMESTIC, INTERNATIONAL

bound: IN or OUT

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

summary(passengers)
passengers<- subset(passengers, select = 2:10)
passengers<- subset(passengers, select = -9)
passengers<- subset(passengers, select = -6)
passengers<- subset(passengers, select = -3)

passengers %>%  separate(Year, c("Year", "Year_next"), "-") -> passengers

passengers<- subset(passengers, select = -3)

p1<- gather(passengers,DOMESTIC, count, 3:4, na.rm = TRUE)
p1<- gather(p1,INTERNATIONAL, count, 3:4, na.rm = TRUE)

p1$DOMESTIC[p1$DOMESTIC=="OUTBOUND"] <- "OUT"
p1$DOMESTIC[p1$DOMESTIC=="INBOUND"] <- "IN"
p1$INTERNATIONAL[p1$INTERNATIONAL=="OUTBOUND__1"] <- "OUT"
p1$INTERNATIONAL[p1$INTERNATIONAL=="INBOUND__1"] <- "IN"

p1<- gather(p1,type_of_flight,bound,3:4, na.rm = TRUE)

```


#Use your data to make
a barchart of type of flight facetted by year.

a scatterplot of domestic inbound vs outbound passengers facetted by year. There are three airports with much higher numbers, which are these three?

a scatterplot of international inbound vs outbound passengers facetted by year

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


ggplot(p1,aes(x=type_of_flight)) +
  geom_bar(aes(weight=count)) +
  facet_wrap(~Year,ncol=6)


```

```{r}
p2 <- filter(p1,type_of_flight== "DOMESTIC")

ggplot(p2, aes(x=bound, y= count)) +
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("domestic inbound vs outbound ") + 
  ylab("count") + 
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)+
  facet_wrap(~Year,ncol=6)
```
#Total Australia, Sydney and Melbourne


```{r}
p3 <- filter(p1,type_of_flight== "INTERNATIONAL")
ggplot(p3, aes(x=bound, y= count)) +
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("domestic inbound vs outbound ") + 
  ylab("count") + 
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)+
  facet_wrap(~Year,ncol=6)
```

##Write a paragraph explaining what you learn from each of the plots


#barchart is good to compare the few category, and scatterplot is useful for compare the units inside a variable. when we use facets, its much easiler to obersever the changing in different years.
