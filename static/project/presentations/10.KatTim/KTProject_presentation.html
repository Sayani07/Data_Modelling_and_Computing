- Visualisations, Analysis and Findings 
- Conclusions
- References

# Data description

- We sourced our data from Kaggle (recently acquired by Google), frequented mainly by statisticians and data miners. 
- Our dataset 'Countries of the World' contains data from 228 countries. 
- Interested in investigating factors which influence economic health as well as variables which act as good measures of economic health based on their relationships with GDP Per Capita. 
- URL:https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world/data

---
#  Variables of Interest 
-  Geographic: Country, Region, Climate &amp; Coastal 
-  Population: Population Density, Birth Rate, Death Rate &amp; Net Migration 
-  Health: Infant Mortality
-  Education: Literacy Rate 
-  Revenue Sectors: Agriculture, Industry &amp; Service 
-  Material: GDP per Capita &amp; Phones per 1000
---
#  Research Questions

- 1.Do countries with lower population densities have higher GDP per Capita? 
- 2.Which global regions are people tending to migrate to and which regions are people tending to emigrate from? 
- 3.Does a country's climate type relate to their GDP per Capita? 
- 4.What relationships exist between Infant Mortality, GDP per Capita, Literacy Rates and Phones per 1000? 
- 5.How does GDP vary across regions? 
- 6.What sectors do countries from different regions primarily rely on as a source of income? 
---
###   Tidying and Cleaning of Data
- Used read-in functions to:
  - Convert commas to decimals
  - Rename variables
  - Remove unwanted spaces in strings
&lt;img src="KTProject_presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Removed one entry due to missing values for majority of variables
- 65% of variables contain missing values
- However, overall proportion of missing values is only 2%
- Therefore, there is enough data to impute values for each variable
---
### Imputation - Birth Rate
- Plot of Birth Rate against Phones
&lt;img src="KTProject_presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Clear non-linear relationship
- Apply log tranformation to Phones

```
(Intercept) log(Phones) 
  48.947922   -5.804763 
  r.squared
1 0.7537107
```
- R-squared indicates relatively good model fit
---

#### 1. Do countries with lower population densities have higher GDP per Capita?

- Scatterplot (x=GDP per capita, y=Population Density, colour = Country)
- Log y scale for easier visualisation

- Weak Correlation factor of 0.19
- Reject our hypothesis that countries with a lower population density may have higher GDP per Capita 
- Countries such as India and China had very high populations and low GDP per Capita 
- Conversely San Marino and Luxembourg had very high GDP per Capita and low population rates
- Mauritius can act as global average of population density compared to GDP per capita

#### 2. Which global regions are people tending to migrate to and which regions are people tending to emigrate from? 

- Ordered from negative to positive net migration

- Limited by unknown time period
- Use of unique data characteristics to estimate time period: Afghanistan's unexpectedly high net migration rate of 23 per 1000
- Iran launched a repatriation program deeming Afghans in Iran of a lower status 
- Secondary sources recording net positive migration of 20+ out of 1000 in Afghanistan during time period 1992-1995 
- Some stong positive net migration in the Near East (Kuwait and Qatar) and almost all of Western Europe 
- Stong negative net migration from Oceanic islands (Samoa and Fiji) as well as Latin American countries (Ecuador and Dominica)

#### 3. What relationships exist between Infant Mortality, GDP per Capita, Literacy Rates and Phones per 1000? 


&lt;img src="KTProject_presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Decreasing exponential relationship between Infant Mortality and GDP per capita
- Limitations in modern medicine and law of diminishing returns 
- Strong linear relationship between Phones and GDP per Capita (correlation coefficient of 0.83) 
- Perhaps phones can be used as a good proxy variable/ indicator of economic wealth 
- Strong negative correlation (-0.72) between Infant Mortality and Literacy Rate 
- Government funding towards health and education tend to reflect one another

#### 4. What sectors do countries from different regions primarily rely on as a source of income?

- Proportioned Bar Chart (x = country, y = ratio of sector income)
- Each included country is representative of the broader region based on their exhibition of typical or mean features
&lt;img src="KTProject_presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

- Division into Agriculture, Industry and Service sectors 
- In Grenada the Service industry dominates significantly making up 75% of the total
- 70% of the service sector in Grenada can be attributed to tourism 
- Nigeria has the lowest Service rate and instead relies heavily on the  Industry and Agriculture sectors 
- Agriculture, Oil, Mining and Energy are listed as Nigeria's major sources of income 
- Results for individual countries within a region vary significantly 
---

# Conclusion
- Essential to know the time period of the dataset and have a legend explaining all variables
- No strong relationship could be identified between GDP per Capita and population or population density
- The strongest positive net migration existed amongst Western European countries and some Near East Countries 
- The strongest emigration was found amongst Oceanic islands and Latin American countries
- Significant relationships between variables Infant Mortality, GDP per Capita, Literacy Rate and Phones existed 
- In the countries for which we observed Revenue categories, the service sector appeared to be the largest, followed by Industry and then Agriculture
