# Missing Values

&lt;img src="Final_Project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

As you can see, a large number of variables contain almost no missing values whatsoever. However, in cleaning our data we can boil down the variables that do have missing data like "funded time" and "disbursed" as the same as date, which isn't missing any values. As such, through our process we are able to clean out all missing values, resulting in a clean dataset that produces 0 missing values.

# Questions

1.Is there any differences in the loan application process or result with females in comparison to males? If so, how?

2.Does the size of the loan receive depend on the industry that you're in?

3.Which industries or types of activities are more dependent on looking for a loan system? Count actvities/sector + loan amount vs sector to look at it deeper.

4.In how many instances does the loan amount equal the funded amount, and if they differ, why could that be? 

5.What's the most popular term for loans and repayment type, and dependent on the term of the loans, how does the repayment length vary?

6.Does the loan amount increase as the lender amount increases? 

7.Does the loan/funded amount depend on the currency it's given in/the country asking for it? 

8.Does the amount of donations increase over time?

Loan application process and result differed greatly on gender
-	64% of borrowers were (just) females
-	20.5% of borrowers were (just) male
-	14.9% of borrowers were mixed (male/female) borrowers

Thus, you are significantly more likely to receive funds if you are female
-	likely attributable to the predominance of female sectors and activities
-	Hence, comprising the majority of the application and acceptance base

The three best performing sectors were (for both number of loans and gross raised funds):
-	Agriculture
-	Food
-	Retail

The rationale for the high quantity of loans for these sectors are:
-	High demand for businesses in these sectors
-	Low default rate
-	Lower average loan amount

For the lower funded sectors (under 1000 loans each):
-	Entertainment
-	Wholesale
-	Likely attributable to the lower amount of businesses in these sectors

---

-	Very little variation in the mean raised amounts for each activity
-	All activities average between $600-$8,000
-	Sizeable difference between activities that receive the most and fewest loans
-	Demand can be inferred from table 3
-	Particularly evident in the top 4 activities (farming, general stores, agriculture and food production/sales)
-	Inverse evident for the bottom activities

*In how many instances does the loan amount equal the funded amount, and if they differ, why could that be?*

-	Identify any observation that doesnâ€™t lie on y=x function, hence funded amount does not equal loan amount
-	48,021 observations where funded amount does not equal loan amount
-	48,019 observations where funded amount &gt; loan amount
-	$788 average difference for the loan being larger than the funded amount
-	Intuitive model
-	Calculate a tidy function of
-	Funded amount estimated by loan amount
-	For every dollar loaned by the agent, Kiva lenders lend $0.87
-	This is a strong and significant representation with an R-Squared of 0.87

---

-	Short loan terms are more popular
-	Likely attributable to:
-	Quicker repayment
-	Interest free loans (limited effect of inflation)
-	Monthly repayments are the most popular loan type (51%)
-	Irregular repayments closely followed (38.3%)
-	Monthly repayments are the longest schedule
-	Providing flexibility in repayments
-	Helpful for businesses with limited liquid assets
-	Longer term loans are either for higher-education costs or farming
-	Higher loan demand, with limited profitability over short term

*Does the amount raised for the crowdfund increase as the lender amount increases?*

---

-	Likelihood of getting your crowdfund raised dependent on sector
-	agriculture, retail, and clothing are the most frequent loan sectors
-	Agriculture has limited repayment abilities

---

*Does the raised amount depend on the currency it's given in/the country asking for it?*

-	From the top currencies we can identify the most prominent Kiva countries
-	United States (USD), Kenya (KES), Peru (PEN), West Africa (XOF), and Columbia (COP)
-	Most popular currencies donâ€™t always realise the largest raised amount
-	Largest raised amount in Mexico, not the US
-	Despite large amount of lenders in the US
-	Smaller countries like Peru consistently raise large loans
-	Berma observes the most linear observations

---

*Does the amount of donations increase over time?*

&lt;img src="Final_Project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

-	No indication of growth in Kiva
-	No indication of more donors to the service
-	Contradicts the notion that as a platform grows, the raised amount would increase
