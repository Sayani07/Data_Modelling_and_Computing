## Overview

- Data description
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Handling missing values
- Three questions base on our data set and Plots
- Interesting discovery
- References

## Data description

- Our data set is from [Australian government data website on road deaths](https://data.gov.au/dataset/australian-road-deaths-database/resource/fd646fdc-7788-4bea-a736-e4aeb0dd09a8?view_id=8443fbb0-09b2-4aca-829b-a11f575d4ac3)
- This data set records all the crashes in Australia between January 1989 to March 2018
- "-9" in the data set stands for missing values

---
## Variables 

   1.Crash ID
   
   2.The state in which this crash occurred
   
   3.The year of the crash occurred
   
   4.The month of the crash occurred
   
   5.The time of the crash occurred
   
   6.The speed limit where the crash occurred
   
   7.The gender of the driver
   
   8.The age of the driver
   
   9.The type of crash

---
## Data cleaning, transformation and handle missing values

- Step1: Replace "-9" as "NA", "Speed_Limit", "Age", "Time" and "Gender" have misssing value.
- Step2: Convert "State", "Month", "Dayweek", "Crash_Type" and "Gender" as factor.
- Step3: Speed_Limit get "888" and "900", seems unreasonable, but we found "900" might stand for "No limit" and "888" might be a outlier. Therefore, we replace "888" as "NA" and "No 900" as "No limit".
- Step4: Capture the hour of the time, replace "Time" as "Hour".
- Step5: The missing value in "Hour" and "Gender" is less than 0.1%, we simply drop the cases missing here.
- Step6: Use kNN in package "VIM" to compute the missing value in "Speed_Limit" and "Age".

##  Questions will be answering

#### Q1:Which states have the highest crash rate? why?

#### Q2:Is month, day of week and Hour affect the crashes? why?

#### Q3:How "Age" and "Gender" affect the different type of crashes?

## Q1:Which states have the highest crash rate?

## Why the crash rate in Northern Territory was much higher than other states? 

1.Among NT road users, alcohol usage is high and seatbelt usage is low.

2.NT roads are almost invariably single lane and unseparated, many are unsealed, they are subject to the extremes of weather and are also exposed to wandering livestock and wildlife.

3.Before 2007, there was no speed limit on most NT highways.In 2007, in response to the high road toll, the NT Government introduced speed limits of 130 km/h on the four main highways and 110 km/h on other rural roads

```
[1] 55
[1] 46
```

- We found the aveage crash cases of each year in NT drop form 55 to 46 after 2007.

---
## Q2:Is month, day of week and Hour affect the crashes? why?

&lt;img src="ETC1010_Project_Presentation_files/figure-html/crashdayweek-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- The reason might be there's more public holiday in December and less in February.

---
&lt;img src="ETC1010_Project_Presentation_files/figure-html/crash_dayweek-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Crash happened more frequently on Friday to Sunday, the rason might be people might more prossible to drive after drank in weekend and Friday night. 

---
&lt;img src="ETC1010_Project_Presentation_files/figure-html/crash_hour-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- 3pm is the most dangerous time for the road users.

---
## Q3:How "Age" and "Gender" affect the different type of crashes?

&lt;img src="ETC1010_Project_Presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## Interesting discovery

- The crash rate in NT is 3 times as other states. Before 2007, there was no speed limit on most NT highways.
- 3pm is the most dangerous time for the road users of the day.
- There is a higher proportion of males than females involved in fatalities
