# Data description

- Data source: Kaggle
- Focus on geneder equality within the US workforce
- There is a particular emphasis on weekly wages amongst male and females in various working sectors
- Sample of weekly income from male/female full time workers
- It can be generally said that there is a noticeable difference between both wages and total of workers (being male or female) in the various working sectors


---
#  What's in the data

- Demographic of individuals' data were from full-time and salary workers in the United States, taken as of Jan 2015
- Categories such as: chief executives, construction managers, civil engineers, judicial law clerks and occupational  therapists were assessed
- The column variables denote the total number of workers in thousands, total weekly income in US dollars, total number of male workers in thousands, weekly income of male workers in USD, total number of female workers in thousands, and weekly income of female workers in USD.
---
#  Questions will be answering

- 1.Will gender influence the weekly salaries of workers in the same industry?
- 2.Will there be a gender count inequality amongst the industries?
- 3.Is there a particular industry/working sector that has more male workers than female workers? (vice-versa)
- 4.Which industries have the highest pay discrepancy in male and female workers?
- 5.Which job type has the most total amount of workers?
- 6.How are wages distributed amongst men and women?

#   Process of exploring data/ Different forms of data and making them tidy
- Initial data are all numerical observations and contains variables of average weekly wage and gender count
- 1.Extracted and gathered the columns so that appropriate tidy formatt was presented
- 2.Use of R studio packages to assess missing data and enact appropriate imputations, use of knn nearest neighbour imputations
- 3.Collated the data into various working sectors, by capital letter wording
- 4.Graphs were made to assess the questions asked
- 5.Models were made to assess the questions asked

#  Making basic plots

# Question 1. Will gender influence the weekly salaries of workers in the same industry?

- Relationship between weekly salary and gender
- Variable used: "Median weekly wage" and "gender".
- Boxplot (x=gender, y=median weekly wage), facetted by occupation

- Boxplot shows males have overall higher median weekly wage
- When occupations are facetted, higher paying occupations show this relationship most notably
- Therefore, gender effects wage in higher paying occupations
---
# Question 2. Will there be a gender count inequality amongst the industries?

- Analysing relationship between industry type and gender count
- Summary statistic of total gender count
- Barchart of x=occupation and y=number of workers
---
&lt;img src="Presentation-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Question 3. Is there a particular industry/working sector that has more male workers than female workers? (vice-versa)

- Analysing relationship between industry type and gender count
- Variable used: "Industry type" and "Gender count"
- 100% chart showing distribution of gender facetted on occupation type
---
&lt;img src="Presentation-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- General trend showing male&gt;female in the workforce
- Particular sectors that are male dominated: transportation, production, construction, maintanence and agriculture
- Particular sectors that are female dominated: education, healthcare, service, healthcare and office
---
# Question 4. Which industries have the highest pay discrepancy in male and female workers?

&lt;img src="Presentation-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Industries like sales, legal, production and transportation favour males
- No industries favour women
---
# Question 5. Which job type has the most total amount of workers?

- Analysing total worker counts in each sector
- Summary charts show: Office (13894), management(12480) and sales(9725) as being top 3 most populated industries
&lt;img src="Presentation-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Question 6. How are wages distributed amongst men and women?

- Analysing the relationship between median weekly wage and occupation/gender
- Variable used: "Median weekly wage", "Gender", "Occupation type"
- Density plot (x=median weekly wage, y=count) and facetted on gender
---
&lt;img src="Presentation-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Female workers have a stronger right skew, showing uneven pay distribution
- Male workers have a more 'normally' distributed pay distribution
- Hence, there are more females paid less and more males paid more on average

- Both models have low R squared
- P-values reveal the influence of gender is statistically insignificant
---
# Conclusion- Interesting discovery:  

- There is a wage gap between female and male workers
- Male workers earn more on average, regardless of occupation
- However this gap is statistically insignificant overall
- Several industries that have gender inequality: male dominated fields include construction and maintainence and female dominated fields include healthcare support and healthcare
- However overall the effect of gender on total number of workers is statistically insignificant
- Limited information to use as proxy in our modelling regressions and so modelled data may not be most accurate
- More research, data and testing is required to draw more concrete conclusions about gender equality in the workforce
