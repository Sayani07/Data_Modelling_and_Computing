#Data Description


- Our data is focused on the topic of the living information from Airbnb, and provide the data of all Airbnb house that opened in Melbourne. 
- Resource:
   The database we choose was acquired from Inside Airbnb, a website that shares datasets for the general public to use and analyze.
   http://data.insideairbnb.com/australia/vic/melbourne/2017-04-03/data/listings.csv.gz
- Number of samples: 14305 
- Number of variables: 95


---
#Examples of variables
-    ID of the house; 
-    Name of the House; 
-    The information of each house; 
-    The information of each host; 
-    The type of house; 
-    Room type of the house (apartment, house, villa, etc), 
-    Number of the bedrooms; 
-    The price of the house and so on.

#Questions
- Is there any influence of the price with the house type of the airbnb?
- Is there a trend of Airbnb's price with distance?
- Which kind of bed will get the higher rating scores?
- Are the descriptions provided by host relevant with the attitude of the host?
- How many host cannot get any review?
- Which suburb has the highest average price?
- What kinds of factors will affect the price?
- What kinds of factors will affect the rating?

#Data Processing

##Check variable data types and missing percentage within the dataset

- The whole dataset was divided by four types of data, including "character", "Date", "integer" and "numeric".  
---
##Check variable data types and missing percentage within the dataset
- “Character” data occupied most in all data and there were a few “Date” and “numeric” data. 
     For missing value, the situation that descriptive variables lost data was relatively serious, which met our expectations.

##Use shp file to get suburb by coordinates, get the google map of Melbourne
- We used the shp file which was provided by Victorian government, since the location information expect for longitude and latitude was not accurate and clear in original dataset.
- url : https://data.gov.au/dataset/af33dd8c-0534-4e18-9245-fc64440f742e/resource/3b946968-319e-4125-8971-2a33d5bf000c/download/viclocalitypolygonshp.zip
- The shp can help us use longitude and latitude to obtain the concrete suburb of houses. 
- Moreover, we use ggmap function to download the map of Melbourne which was saved as rds file.
---
##Count characters of the text data of each listing
- A considerable part of text data was not English in original dataset.
- We opt to count the characters of every listing so as to measure how much time and energy the hosts spent to type all the text content.

##Delete the variables that are not relevant with the analysis, tidy the rest of the variables
- We deleted all of the valuables irrelevant to our analysis, tidied some character variables and extracted some necessary information

##Calculate the distance to Melbourne central by coordinates
- We used the latitude and longitude coordinates to calculate the distance (km) between house and Melbourne central.

#Findings
##Is there any influence of the price with the house type of the airbnb?
- The relationship between “price” &amp; “house type”
- Variable used: “property type” &amp; “price”
- Boxplot (x= recorder(property_type); y= price)
&lt;img src="Analysis_of_Melbourne_Airbnb_market_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
##Is there is a trend of Airbnb’s price with distance?
- The relationship between “price” &amp; “distance”
- Variable used: “the distance between the location of Airbnb and Melbourne Central” &amp; “price”
&lt;img src="Analysis_of_Melbourne_Airbnb_market_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
##Which kinds of factors will get the higher rating scores?
- The relationship between “bed-type” &amp; “price”
- Variable used: “different kinds of bed-type” &amp; “price”
&lt;img src="Analysis_of_Melbourne_Airbnb_market_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
##Are the description provided by host relevant with the attitude of the host?
- The relationship between “description provided by host” &amp; “attitude of the host”
&lt;img src="Analysis_of_Melbourne_Airbnb_market_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

&lt;img src="Analysis_of_Melbourne_Airbnb_market_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
##How many host cannot get any review?
- 3042 
- 21.31297%

##Which surbub has the highest average price?
- Banholme ($2500) has the highest average price. 

- And, if we ignore the suburb with less than 10 airbnb houses, the Port Melbourne ($282) has the highest average price. It seems more reasonable, because Port Melbourne is an upscale coastal suburb.
---
##What kinds of factors will affect the price?
- log-level model:

- log(price)=0.04Rating + 0.121Accommodate + 4.159EntireHome + 3.513PrivateRoom + e

- R^2=0.99352

- After the T-test, it seems that all the estimate of factors is significant at 5% level. Because we had used the log-linear function as our model for these observations. So we can gain the percentage change in y given one unit increase in x
---
##What kinds of factors will affect the rating?

- Level-level model:

- Rating= 91.2Airbed + 95.2Couch + 90.2Futon + 93.1Pull-out sofa + 91.5Realbed + 0.3TV + 1.3Net + 1.0Aircondition - 0.7Pool + 0.2PrivateRoom - 7.3SharedRoom + 3.7Superhost + e

- R^2=0.9932766

- After the T-test, it seems that all the estimate of factors is significant at 5% level, expect TV and Private room. Because all these variables are categories variables, we need to compare them in their groups.
---
##Conclusion
- Through the data analysis, we can have a relative overview of Airbnb market and which factor guests pay much attention on. And we hope these analysis can help the visitor who wants to travel to Melbourne to find the most suitable Airbnb for them.
