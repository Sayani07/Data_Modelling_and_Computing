# Data description

URL - https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-

- Gathered from the Gallup World Poll.  
- Analyses 100+ crucial world issues affecting people's lives.
- Data from years 2005-2016
- Variable explored: Life ladder, GDP, Social support, Life expectancy, Freedom, Trust/Corruption
- Explores happiness, socio-economic condition and politics in a country.

#  Questions we will be answering
1) According to the life ladder, what countries have improved the most in the 5 year period? Which the least?

2) Is the famous saying "money can't by happiness" true?

3) Perhaps the key to happiness is health. Does expecting to have a longer life increase a person's life satisfaction?

4) Does deceit in the government lead to misery in the population?

5) Perhaps these various philosophies for how happiness manifests are actually related. Can wealth buy a person greater freedom?

6) Do deceitful/corrupt governments prosper economically?

7) In a perfect world, people would be free to do as they please. Over the last few years has freedom increased?

#   Process of exploring data/ Different forms of data and making them tidy
- Check for and exclude missing values.
- Excluded redundant variables
- Added region data from another data set
- Created dataframes for easy manipulation

#  Looking at the data

*1. According to the life ladder, what countries have improved the most in the 5 year period? Which the least?*

- Difference in life ladder (2012-2016)
- Life ladder: national average of personal life rating
- Coloured by region
---
&lt;img src="Project_presentation2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- A bar chart easily shows the differences in the y variable
- Average of -0.5
- Most improved is Taiwan
- Least improved is Chad
- Sub-saharan Africa is the least improved region
---

# 2. Is the famous saying "money can't by happiness" true?

- Log GDP per capita against life ladder response.
- GDP per capita: countries GDP divided by population. Log used due to large variation.
- Faceted by year
---
&lt;img src="Project_presentation2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Life ladder response assumed to indicate happiness.
- GDP per capita does not often reflect individual wealth in a country.
- Strong positive correlation
---
# 3. Perhaps the key to happiness is health. Does expecting to have a longer life increase a person's life satisfaction?

- Life expectancy against life ladder.
- Life expectancy: Life expectancy of a healthy child at birth
- Life ladder assumed to be happiness
---
&lt;img src="Project_presentation2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Viridis plot shows high density points clearly
- Strong positive relationship exists above age 60.
- Our Linear model suggests that for every 1 year increase, life ladder increases by 0.03.
- Non-linear trend
---

# 4. Does deceit in the government lead to misery in the population?

- Perception of corruption in government against life ladder
- Perceptions of corruption: Is corruption widespread throughout the government and/or business? Average of binary answer
- Lifeladder assumed to be misery/happiness
---
&lt;img src="Project_presentation2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Viridis plot shows high density points clearly
- Negative correlation.
- Non-linear relationship.
---

# 5. Perhaps these various philosophies for how happiness manifests are actually related. Can wealth buy a person greater freedom?

- GDP per capita against Perception of freedom
- Percetpion of freedom: Are you satisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life? Average of binary answer
- Coloured by region
---
&lt;img src="Project_presentation2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Slight relationship.
- Region data shows african countries are poorer but more free

---

# 6. Do deceitful/corrupt governments prosper economically?

- Perception of corruption in government against GDP per capita
- Coloured by region.
---
&lt;img src="Project_presentation2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Most likely non-linear relationship.
- High level of pereception of corruption across the scale
- Countries of south-east Asia fair the best
- Sub-saharan african countries fair the worst
---

# 7. In a perfect world, people would be free to do as they please. Over the last few years has freedom increased?

- The change in freedom over the years
- Line chart

- Analysis
- Changes in freedom values could be attributed to new laws enacted in the country, political stability, war and famine.
Drop in 2012, GFC?
- Australia: Relatively stable and high freedom score. Dip in 2007, possibly due to GFC.
- Afghanistan: Steady decrease in freedom, attributed to political instability and war.
- South Africa: South Africa wide range of freedom values. Possible reasons are political instability and water shortages.

# Conclusion- Interesting discovery:  
There is no one factor that results in an increase in a country's happiness, but many factors that influence it.
Expected correlations with happiness are typically supported.
Strong relationships with happiness: country's GDP and life expectancy.
Perception of corruption dips largely after a logGDP value of 10.5

Limitations:
- Many relationships seemed non-linear, so linear model was not ideal in these cases.
- Data was often generalised to make meaningful inferences. (e.g. average of binary questions)
- More modelling of different variables to further determine what improves happiness in a country 

That's all, Thanks for listening
