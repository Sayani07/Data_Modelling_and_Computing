- Data tidying process

- Visualizations and analysis

- Conclusions

- References

---
# Data Description
- Data includes around 125 college students' food habits, including their food choices, preferences, nutrition, etc.

- Our aim is to understand the eating habits of college students and the factors behind these habits. 

- Data sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/borapajo/food-choices

# Posed Questions

- How does a college student's self-imposed importance of calories and their self-perception of weight affect their actual weight?

- Why do college students eat comfort food?

- Which comfort foods are popular amongst students?

- Does a parent's profession affect their home-cooking frequency?

- Does a parent's home-cooking frequency affect a student's eating habits?

- Does an individual's health affect how rewarding they find life?

layout: false

## Importance of calories vs weight
&lt;img src="OTN_Presentation_files/figure-html/Variables Affecting Weight: Plot-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Trend in Males
- Increasing range in males

---
## Self Perception of weight vs weight
&lt;img src="OTN_Presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Higher number = perceived as more overweight
- Self-perception reflects weight
- Large range
- Limited to absolute value

# Comfort Food Analysis

## What is emotional eating?
- **emotional eating:** "an increase in food intake in response to negative emotions" [(Definition)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2006.10.005)
- Typically a coping mechanism for many students!
- But what kind of foods do college students consume, and for what reasons?

---
layout: false

## "What kind of foods do students like to eat for comfort?"
- Text analysis was conducted on the short-response columns. Students listed:
  - the foods they liked to eat
  - reasons why they typically ate
- Token Frequencies were calculated by gender
- Quantiles were calculated to determine the cutoffs for terms of interest




```r
Frequency &lt;- c(quantile(cf_token_total$total,probs = 0.9), quantile(cf_fem$n, probs = 0.9),
           quantile(cf_mal$n, probs = 0.9))
Group &lt;- c("All", "Female", "Male")
top_foods_table &lt;- cbind(Group, Frequency)
knitr::kable(top_foods_table, format = "html")
```

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Group &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Frequency &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 90% &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; All &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 12.8 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 90% &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Female &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 7 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 90% &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Male &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 5 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

- Ice cream was split into two tokens
  - Similar counts in the first graph indicate that both tokens typically referred to ice cream
  - Ice Snapps was an exception
- Primarily sweet foods (Ice Cream, Pizza, Chocolate, Cookies) were preferred by more female students than male students
- Male students preferred both sweet and savoury foods.
- The top foods were preferred by a greater proportion of female students
  - female students' preferences accounted for 65.8% of the top foods listed
  - statistic reflects the general proportion of comfort foods listed by each gender
  - female respondents tended to list more foods than male respondents (64.2%)
  
---

## "Why do students eat comfort food?"
- Once again, the short-response column was tokenised and frequencies were calculated
- The sentiment analysis conducted used the AFINN lexicon
  - Due to the low number of total sentiments captured in the dataset, all captured sentiments were used in plotting



```r
Frequency &lt;- c(quantile(cr_tokens_total$total,probs = 0.9),
           quantile(cr_fem$n, probs = 0.9),
           quantile(cr_mal$n, probs = 0.9))
Group &lt;- c("All", "Female", "Male")

top_reasons_table &lt;- cbind(Group, Frequency)
knitr::kable(top_reasons_table, format = "html")
```

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Group &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Frequency &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 90% &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; All &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 9.90000000000001 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 90% &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Female &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 3.9 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 90% &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Male &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 7.2 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

## Comfort Food Reasons

- Respondents of both genders cited boredom as the top reason
- Further reasons observe a different split in proportions
  - Female survey respondents cited stress as a reason to eat for comfort 3 times more frequently than males
- After Boredom, the next highest reasons were all emotional

- While more females cited the top reasons (Boredom, Sadness and Stress) than males, the next three top reasons were all cited by more males than females
  - This included Happiness, Anger and Hunger
  - Males reported that they were more likely to eat out of happiness than females, but they were also more likely to cite eating out of anger

## Sentiment Analysis on Reasons

- A vast majority of the reasons reported were negative
  - Top reasons Boredom and Sad(ness) rated -2 by the AFINN sentiment lexicon
    - Negative values [indicate an "intrinsic averseness"](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010), or negativity of a term/emotion
- Female responses accounted for a greater variety of emotions and mental states than male responses
- The large skew of negatively classified emotions supports the idea that many eat for intrinsically negative emotions and reasons

#  Effect of a parent's profession on their home-cooking frequency


&lt;img src="OTN_Presentation_files/figure-html/Parents Cooking Given Profession: Plot Formatting-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.small[- Most parents cooked almost every day regardless of profession 
- Exception: Fathers in teaching and mothers in stem tended to cook less frequently
- Unemployed parents or those who worked in management were more likely to cook

- The data has not been analysed based on both parent's professions concurrently so similarities between the different professions for mother and father may be from pairings]

#  Effect of a parent's home-cooking frequency on a student's cooking and eating out frequency


&lt;img src="OTN_Presentation_files/figure-html/Student Cooking Frequency given Parents Cooking History: Plot Formatting-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
.small[- The proportion where parents never cooked is always 1 as only 1 student had this answer so it was excluded from the plots to prevent misrepresentation of data

- Most students, regardless of gender, do not cook very often 
- Females do cook more frequently than males, regardless of whether their parents cooked for them frequently as children

- Most students will eat out during the week, at least 1-2 times, regardless of whether their parents cooked for them]

# How does healthiness affect outlook on life?

&lt;img src="OTN_Presentation_files/figure-html/Health on Happiness: Plot-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Upwards trend between how healthy a student feels and how rewarding they find life
  - Large variance and many outliers; not exact proof

---

layout: true
class: middle

# Conclusions

- Most students place moderate importance on caloric consumption

- Boredom is the top reason behind consuming comfort food
  - Most reasons are negative
  
- Most students don't cook much, irrespective of parents' cooking habits

- Healthiness appears to correlate with a rewarding life
