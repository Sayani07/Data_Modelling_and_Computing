\centerline{\Large\bf ETC1010 Project}

\large 
\bigskip 
\bigskip The project is designed to give you
experience collecting or finding your own dataset, determining the
appropriate questions to answer about the data, and planning how to
execute analysis of the data.  The project involves several parts. 

\begin{enumerate} \itemsep 0in
\item Locate a suitable data source and determine appropriate questions that could be answered using this data. 
\item Cleaning of your data, in order to answer your questions. This is the important part to illustrate in your project, because we are expecting you to be able to demonstrate your ability to take a messy data set and organise it for later analysis.
\item Simple analysis using methods covered in class; exploratory data analysis, numerical and visual summaries of the data, and the application of basic modeling strategies. The focus is on trying to answer some of the questions you posed. You are not expected to answer all, if you have a long lots of questions. 
\item Describe your cleaning procedures and analytics in a short project write-up, {\bf no more than 5 pages}. You  should include why you chose the data and what learned about the problem by completing this project.
\item Present your report in class,  \textbf{10-15 minute oral presentation}.
\end{enumerate}

This project will be conducted collaboratively, with team of your choices, and with  i\textbf{a maximum team size of 6.} Your team can include members from different tutorials. To ensure correct marks are awarded, please carefully document, in detail, your individual contributions to the project. Each team member is expected to participate substantially in all aspects of the work, including the writing and oral presentation.
